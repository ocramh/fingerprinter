# Fingerprinter

Fingerprinter generates audio fingerprints from music files and uses the to identify metadata associate with them from the MusicBrainz APIs

This tool leverages Chromaprint and its associated Acoustid Web service to generate and parse acoustic fingerprinting and ultimately verify the origin and content of an audio file.
Specifically Fingerprinter can use the generated audio fingerprint to determine the author, album, record label and ISRC codes associated with a recording.
